            <h2>My Lego Set</h2>
            <p>This is the lego set I bought recently. The other day I randomly had an urge to waste money and spend money on lego's after seeing an AD on youtube. It cost $230 dollars, 
            I am now $230 less than I was a week ago. I was incredibly happy building it until i found out either <b>I</b> lost a piece. 
            Or the piece didn't come in the set, now I have to figure out how to order a single tiny lego piece. When I checked it online it was .30 cents to a dollar but <b>$8.00</b> shipping costs, that's insane!
            So now I just have a bunch of lego pieces sitting on a table in my room that I haven't touched, everything <u>was</u> going well.
